# CardgameMVL-Creation-Kit

This "Creation-Kit" is my own development kit used to create cards for my other project @ https://github.com/IncludeMori/Cardgame_W  

Features include updating card art, changing stats such as attack, or updating other card information.

This project was part of my initial C++ & GameDev journey when I was younger, therefore the code might be quite messy :)
